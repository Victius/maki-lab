<h3>1.4 Normalizer and Centralizer</h3>

<h4>Cosets equals to cosets</h4>

<p>​    Here we have a right coset $Hx$ of subgroup $H$ in group $G$, and choose an arbitrary coset in $G$, make it equal to $Hx$. What results can we get? First we list all kinds of equations: ($x,y\in G,K\leqslant G$)</p>

<p>| $Hx = Hx$ | $Hx=xH$   |
| --------- | --------- |
| $Hx = Hy$ | $Hx = yH$ |
| $Hx = Kx$ | $Hx = xK$ |
| $Hx = Ky$ | $Hx = yK$ |</p>

<p>​    As you can see, equations at left side are &#39;right cosets = right cosets&#39;, and at right side are &#39;right cosets = left cosets&#39;. Then we discuss them one by one.</p>

<p>​    (1). $Hx = Hx$. Identical equation.
​    (2). $Hx = Hy$. We have it $\iff xy^{-1}\in H$. (detailed discussion is in section 1.3)
​    (3). $Hx = Kx$. Use the cancellation law: $H=K$.
​    (4). $Hx = Ky$. We have it $\iff Hxy^{-1} = K$. Notice that $K$ is a group, So we use <strong>Property 3.9</strong>, $xy^{-1} \in H$, and $H=K$. You can find this condition is actually the same with condition (2).</p>

<p>​    In conclusion about (1) to (4), we only need to research the condition (2), which we have learned in section 1.3. Now we continue to research the right side.</p>

<p>​    (5). $Hx = xH$. We have:
$$
\begin{align}
Hx = xH &amp;\to x^{-1}Hx = H \
        &amp;\to x^{-1}Hx(x^{-1}Hx)^{-1} = HH^{-1} = H \
        &amp;\to x^{-1}Hx = H \
        &amp;\to Hx = xH
\end{align}
$$
We get the same equations, that is to say, we cannot deal with it use methods before. We stand this condition temporarily.
​    (6). $Hx = yH$. We have:
$$
\begin{align}
Hx = yH &amp;\to y^{-1}Hx = H \
        &amp;\to y^{-1}Hx(y^{-1}Hx)^{-1} = HH^{-1} = H \
        &amp;\to y^{-1}Hxx^{-1}H^{-1}y = H \
        &amp;\to y^{-1}Hy = H \
        &amp;\to Hy = yH
\end{align}
$$
It is the same with condition (5).
​    (7). $Hx = xK$. We have:
$$
\begin{align}
Hx = xK &amp;\to x^{-1}Hx = K \
        &amp;\to x^{-1}Hx(x^{-1}Hx)^{-1} = KK^{-1} = K \
        &amp;\to x^{-1}Hx = K \
        &amp;\to Hx = xK
\end{align}
$$
Like the condition (5), it is also a cycle.
​    (8). $Hx = yK$. We have:
$$
\begin{align}
Hx = yK &amp;\to y^{-1}Hx = K \
        &amp;\to y^{-1}Hx(y^{-1}Hx)^{-1} = KK^{-1} = K \
        &amp;\to y^{-1}Hy = K \
        &amp;\to Hy = yK
\end{align}
$$
It is the same with condition (7).</p>

<p>​    The things at right side are not simple. Equations $Hx=xH$ and $Hx=xK$ always present cyclically, which we can also express as $x^{-1}Hx=H$ and $x^{-1}Hx = K$. Do you feel that they are like something else? In linear algebra, we have if $P\in GL_n(F), A,B\in F^{n\times n}$ and $P^{-1}BP = A$, then matrices $A$ and $B$ have the same eigenvalues. Some other important theorems in linear algebra also have such a form of equation, for example, the spectral theorem.</p>

<h4>Conjugate relation between two subsets</h4>

<p>​    We have just use a very common name to define the equation which present in condition (7).</p>

<p><strong>Definition 4.1</strong> conjugation, $g^{-1}Ag$ or $g^{-1}ag$
    For a <strong>subset</strong> $A$ of a group $G$ and $g\in G$, define $B=g^{-1}Ag$ is a conjugate subset of $A$.
    In particular, for an <strong>element</strong> $a$ of a group $G$ and $g\in G$, define $b=g^{-1}ag$ is a conjugate element of $a$.</p>

<p>​    We immediately know that if $H\leqslant G$, then $K=g^{-1}Hg$ is also a subgroup of $G$. [<strong>Ex 1.4.1</strong>]</p>

<p>​    Why do we weaken the condition &#39;subgroups&#39; to &#39;subsets&#39;? We drop something in order to get more. Just like the fact that &#39;similar relation&#39; between matrices is an equivalence relation, the &#39;conjugate relation&#39; is also an equivalence relation.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 4.2</strong> the conjugate relation
​    Define such a relation between <strong>subsets</strong> of the group $G$: for $A,B\subset G$
$$
A\sim B \iff \exist g\in G, B = g^{-1}Ag
$$
then it is an equivalence relation.</p>

<p>​    <em>Proof</em>: 
​    (1). wts. $A\sim A$. 
​    For any subset $A$, $A = e^{-1}Ae$.
​    (2). wts. If $A\sim B$, then $B\sim A$. 
​    If $A\sim B$, then we have: (for some $g\in G$)
$$
\begin{align}
\because\ &amp; A\sim B \
\therefore\ &amp; B = g^{-1}Ag, \text{ for some }g\in G.\
\therefore\ &amp; A = gBg^{-1} = (g^{-1})^{-1}Bg^{-1}, \text{ for some }g^{-1}\in G. \
\therefore\ &amp; B\sim A
\end{align}
$$
​    (3). wts. If $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$, then $A\sim C$.
​    We have:
$$
\begin{align}
\because\ &amp; A\sim B,B\sim C \
\therefore\ &amp; B = g^{-1}Ag, C = h^{-1}Bh, 
    \text{ for some }g,h\in G. \
\therefore\ &amp; C = h^{-1}(g^{-1}Ag)h = (gh)^{-1}Agh, 
    \text{ for some }g,h\in G.\
\therefore\ &amp; A\sim C
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>​    Because of theorem 4.2, we can say the conjugate relation induces a partition on <strong>power set</strong> $\mathcal{P}(G)$. Further more, we find for any $g\in G$, the order of subset $A$ is equal to its conjugate subset $g^{-1}Ag$. [<strong>Ex 1.4.2</strong>] Therefore, if we define a subset collection $\mathcal{A}<em>n = {A\in \mathcal{P}(G)|\ |A| = n}$ of all &#39;order-$n$&#39; subsets of $G$ ($n&lt;|G|$), then the conjugate relation also induces a partition on $\mathcal{A}</em>n\subset \mathcal{P}(G)$.
​    Maybe you want to ask: What use is conjugate relation? We will answer this good question in the section &#39;group action&#39; which is arranged in Abstract Algebra II.</p>

<h4>Normalizer and Centralizer</h4>

<p>​    Now we have already known the conjugate relation, here and the next section, we will research deeply into a special condition: the self-conjugate, which means $A=g^{-1}Ag$ for several $g\in G$.</p>

<p><strong>Definition 4.3</strong> Normalizer, $N<em>G(A)$
​    For a subset $A$ of a group $G$, define the normalizer of $A$:
$$
N</em>G(A) = {g\in G|\ g^{-1}Ag=A}
$$
which means the collection of all <strong>elements in $G$</strong> that make $A$ be self-conjugate.</p>

<p>​    Here are some examples:</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong> In group $(\Z,+)$, choose a subset $A={1,3,5}$, then $N<em>\Z(A) = \Z$, because for every $n\in\Z$, $n+A = A+n$. In general, if $G$ is an Abelian group, then for arbitrary subset $A$ of $G$, we have $N</em>G(A)=G$. [<strong>Ex 1.4.3</strong>]</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong> In group $GL<em>2(\R)$, choose a subset
$$
A = \left{
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 \
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 \
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
\right}
$$
then
$$
N</em>G(A) =
\left{\left.B=
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; b \
c &amp; d
\end{pmatrix}\in GL_2(\R)\right|\ a=d\text{ and }b=c=0
\right}
$$
​    We will give an important property about the normalizer.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 4.4</strong> the normalizer is a subgroup.
​    For arbitrary <strong>subset</strong> $A$ of $G$, the normalizer of $A$ is a subgroup of $G$.</p>

<p>​    <em>Proof</em>: first, $N<em>G(A)$ is not empty, because the identity $e$ of $G$ is always in the normalizer. Then for any $x,y\in N</em>G(A)$:
$$
\begin{align}
\because\ &amp; x,y\in N<em>G(A) \
\therefore\ &amp; x^{-1}Ax = A,\ y^{-1}Ay = A \
\end{align}
$$
So 
$$
\begin{align}
(xy^{-1})^{-1}A(xy^{-1}) &amp;= y(x^{-1}Ax)y^{-1} \
                         &amp;= yAy^{-1} \
                         &amp;= A &amp;\text{(use $y^{-1}Ay = A$)}
\end{align}
$$
​    That is to say, for any $x,y\in N</em>G(A)$, $xy^{-1}\in N<em>G(A)$, thus we actually proved $N</em>G(A)(N<em>G(A))^{-1}\subset N</em>G(A)$, and the &#39;inverse direction&#39; is obviously correct. So we have $N<em>G(A)(N</em>G(A))^{-1}=N<em>G(A)$, and $N</em>G(A)\leqslant G$.</p>

<p>​    Although $A$ is just a subset, it&#39;s normalizer is a subgroup, too. If we have a subgroup, then we will have cosets and a partition of $G$.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 4.5</strong> the number of conjugate subsets
​    If $A$ is a subset of group $G$, then the number of conjugate subsets of $A$ is equal to the <strong>index</strong> of it&#39;s normalizer, i.e. $[G:N_G(A)]$.</p>

<p>​    <em>Analysis</em>: All of the conjugate subset of $A$ can be expressed as $g^{-1}Ag$ for some $g\in G$. All of the coset of $N<em>G(A)$ can be expressed as $N</em>G(A)g$  for some $g\in G$. Can you find a method to prove these two collections have the same order?</p>

<p>​    <em>Proof</em>: For all $x,y\in G$, we have:
$$
\begin{align}
N<em>G(A)x = N</em>G(A)y &amp;\iff N<em>G(A)xy^{-1}=N</em>G(A) \
                  &amp;\iff xy^{-1}\in N<em>G(A) \
                  &amp;\iff (xy^{-1})^{-1}A(xy^{-1}) = A \
                  &amp;\iff y(x^{-1}Ax)y^{-1} = A \
                  &amp;\iff x^{-1}Ax = y^{-1}Ay
\end{align}
$$
thus the number of right cosets of $N</em>G(A)$ (i.e. the index of $N_G(A)$) is equal to the number of conjugate subsets of $A$.</p>

<p>​    Notice that if $a\in N_G(A)$, we can not say $ag=ga$ for all $g\in A$.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong> In group $S<em>3$, let $A=$
$$
\left{
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\
3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
\right}
$$
Then you can prove that 
$$
g=\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2\
2 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix} \in N</em>G(A)
$$
but for all $a\in A$, $ag\neq ga$. [<strong>Ex 1.4.4</strong>]</p>

<p>​    If $ag=ga$ for all $g\in A$ is satisfied in $N_G(A)$, then we give it another name.</p>

<p><strong>Definition 4.6</strong> Centralizer, $C<em>G(A)$
​    For a subset $A$ of a group $G$, define the centralizer of $A$:
$$
C</em>G(A) = {g\in G|\ g^{-1}ag=a, \forall a\in A}
$$
which means the collection of all <strong>elements in $G$</strong> that make all <strong>elements in</strong> $A$ be self-conjugate.</p>

<p>​    In particular, we called an element $g$ of $G$ the <strong>central element</strong> of $G$ if $g\in C<em>G(G)$, and $C</em>G(G)$ the <strong>center</strong> of $G$ (denoted by $C(G)$ or $Z(G)$).</p>

<p><strong>Example 4</strong> In general, if $G$ is an Abelian group, then for arbitrary subset $A$ of $G$, we have $C_G(A)=G$ and $C(G)=G$. [<strong>Ex 1.4.4</strong>]</p>

<p><strong>Example 5</strong> In group $GL<em>2(\R)$, choose a subset
$$
A = \left{
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 \
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
\right}
$$
then
$$
C</em>G(A) =
\left{\left.B=
\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; b \
c &amp; d
\end{pmatrix}\in GL_2(\R)\right|\ a=d\text{ and }b=c
\right}
$$</p>

<p><strong>Example 6</strong> In group $S<em>3$, let $A=$
$$
\left{
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\
3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
\right}
$$
Then you can prove that 
$$
C</em>G(A) = \left{
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\
3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{pmatrix}
\right}
$$
[<strong>Ex 1.4.6</strong>]</p>

<p>​    Just like the normalizer, we have</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 4.7</strong> the centralizer is a subgroup.
    For arbitrary <strong>subset</strong> $A$ of $G$, the centralizer of $A$ is a subgroup of $G$. Thus the centralizer of $A$ is also a subgroup of the normalizer of $A$. [<strong>Ex 1.4.7</strong>]</p>

<p>​    It is also obviously that for all $a$ in group $G$, its normalizer equals to its centralizer. Thus:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 4.8</strong> the number of conjugate elements
    If $a$ is an element of group $G$, then the number of conjugate subsets of $a$ is equal to the <strong>index</strong> of it&#39;s centralizer, i.e. $[G:C_G(a)]$. [<strong>Ex 1.4.8</strong>]</p>
