<h3>1.5 Normal Subgroup and Quotient Group</h3>

<h4>Normal Subgroup</h4>

<p>​    In section 1.3, we know a group $G$ have such a partition
$$
G = \bigcup_{g\in R} Hg
$$
if $H\leqslant G$. Can we use binary operation between these cosets? In general, $Hx\cdot Hy$ is just itself. It can not equal to other simple things. But, if we have a more condition $\forall g \in G, gH=Hg$, then we have
$$
Hx\cdot Hy=H(Hx)y=H(xy)
$$
which is also a coset of $H$. This fact appeal to us to notice such a special subgroup, which is <strong>commutative</strong> with <strong>all</strong> elements in group $G$.</p>

<p><strong>Definition 5.1</strong> Normal subgroup, $N\lhd G$.</p>

<p>​    If $N$ is a subgroup of $G$, and also satisfied
$$
\forall g\in G, gA=Ag
$$
then we called $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, which is denoted by $N\lhd G$.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong> For all $n\in\Z$, $n\Z\lhd \Z$. This is true because for all $m\in\Z$,
$$
\begin{align}
m + n\Z &amp;= {m+nk|\ k\in\Z} \
        &amp;= {nk+m|\ k\in\Z} \
        &amp;= n\Z + m
\end{align}
$$
<strong>Ex 1.5.1</strong> All subgroup of an Abelian group is a normal subgroup.</p>

<p>​    We have and some interesting result about normal subgroup.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 5.2</strong> &#39;a subgroup which order is <strong>two</strong>&#39;
​    $N$ is a subgroup of $G$. If the order of $N$ equals to two, then $N$ is a normal subgroup.</p>

<p>​    <em>Proof</em>: If $g\in G$ is not in $N$, then
$$
G = N\cup gN = N\cup Ng \quad\text{(Why?)}
$$
so $gN=Ng$.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 5.3</strong> some properties of normal subgroup
​    Assume $N$ is a subgroup of $G$, then TFAE:
​    (1) $N\lhd G$
​    (2) $\forall g\in G, gNg^{-1}=N$ (i.e. $N$ is conjugate with itself.)
​    (3) $\forall g\in G, gNg^{-1}\subset N$
​    (4) $N_G(N)=G$
​    (5) every left coset of $N$ is right coset.</p>

<p>​    <em>Proof</em>:
​    (1)$\iff$(2): the definition of normal subgroup.
​    (2)$\iff$(3): (2)$\to$(3) is obviously. We only need to prove (3)$\to$(2). 
​    If $\forall g\in G, gNg^{-1}\subset N$, then
$$
\begin{align}
   &amp;\forall g\in G: gNg^{-1}\subset N \
\therefore\ &amp;\forall g\in G: N\subset g^{-1}Ng \
\therefore\ &amp;\forall h\in G: N\subset hNh^{-1} &amp;\text{(Let $h=g^{-1}$,and $G=G^{-1}$)}\
\therefore\ &amp;\forall g\in G: N\subset gNg^{-1} &amp;\text{(substitute the &#39;dummy&#39; variable)}
\end{align}
$$
so $\forall g\in G, gNg^{-1}=N$.
​    (2)$\iff$(4): the definition of normalizer.
​    (1)$\iff$(5): (1)$\to$(5) is obviously. We only need to prove (5)$\to$(1).
​    Because of (5), for $g\in G$, there is a $g&#39;\in G$ s.t. $gN=Ng&#39;$. And then $g=ge\in gN=Ng&#39;$, thus $Ng=Ng&#39;=gN$.</p>

<p><strong>Ex 1.5.2</strong> [!] let $G={(a,b)|a\in\mathbb{R}_*,b\in\mathbb{R}}$, define &#39;multiplication&#39;
$$
(a,b)(c,d)=(ac,ad+b)
$$
Let $K={(1,b)|b\in\mathbb{R}}$. Try to prove that: $K\lhd G$.</p>

<p><strong>Ex 1.5.3</strong> Let $N &lt; M &lt; G$.
​    (1) Try to prove that: if $N\lhd G$, then $N\lhd M$.
​    (2) If $N\lhd M$, then do we have the conclusion: $N\lhd G$?</p>

<p><strong>Ex 1.5.4</strong> [*,!] Let $M,N$ are normal subgroups of $G$, if $M\cap N={e}$, then prove that for all $m\in M$ and $n\in N$, $mn=nm$.</p>

<h4>Quotient group</h4>

<p>​    From the discussion above, we seem to say that if $N$ is a normal subgroup of group $G$, then all right (or left, which is actually the same. In order to keep simple, we just called them cosets.) cosets of $N$ form a group. Furthermore, some people may give such a proof:</p>

<p>​    <em>&#39;Proof&#39;</em>: Let $\mathcal{A}$ is the collection of all cosets of $N$, then we have</p>

<p>| $\forall Na,Nb\in\mathcal{A}, Na\cdot Nb\in\mathcal{A}$      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $\forall Na,Nb,Nc\in\mathcal{A}, (Na\cdot Nb)Nc=Na(Nb\cdot Nc)$ |
| $\exist N\in\mathcal{A},\forall Na\in\mathcal{A},Na\cdot N=N\cdot Na=Na$ |
| $\forall Na\in\mathcal{A},\exist Na^{-1}\in\mathcal{A},Na^{-1}\cdot Na=Na\cdot Na^{-1}=N$ |</p>

<p>​    Do you think it is a perfect proof? Here the writer has a question: if elements $Na,Nb\in\mathcal{A}$, which element in $\mathcal{A}$ is equal to $Na\cdot Nb$? Some self-confident people give the writer a definite answer: that&#39;s easy! $Na\cdot Nb = N(ab)$. 
​    OK, now questions continue to appear. We have already know that the order of the coset $Na$ is equal to the order of $N$, that is to say, in general, $N$ is not a one-element set, and we can find a $a&#39;\neq a$ in $Na$. If $a&#39;\in Na$, then $Na&#39;=Na$, because $a&#39;a^{-1}\in N$ (and use <strong>3.11</strong>). So we have a deduction below: if $Na\cdot Nb = N(ab)$ is right, then we have
$$
N(a&#39;b) = Na&#39;\cdot Nb = Na \cdot Nb = N(ab)
$$
​    We finally get a conclusion: if $Na=Na&#39;$, then $N(a&#39;b)=N(ab)$, which is not obvious. This is where the problem lies. It is a good thing that this conclusion in here is right (which we will prove below), but we cannot assure we <em>always</em> have such fortune. So we first prove this, then we keep to discuss this problem.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 5.4</strong> &#39;well-defined&#39; of multiplication of cosets
    Assume $N$ is a normal subgroup of group $G$. $a,a&#39;,b$ are in $G$. If cosets $Na$ equals to $Na&#39;$, then $N(ab)=N(a&#39;b)$.</p>

<p>​    <em>Proof</em>: we wts. $(ab)(a&#39;b)^{-1}\in N$, which is obviously right. ($aa&#39;^{-1}\in N$).</p>

<p>​    Just like the sub-title of <strong>5.4</strong>, we usually called this type of problem &#39;well-defined&#39;. What does it means? At the beginning of this course, we have introduced the <strong>binary operation</strong>, which has the form of a map:
$$
f:A\times B\to C,\ (a,b)\mapsto f(a,b)
$$
Back to our problem, the binary operation is
$$
\cdot: \mathcal{A}\times \mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}, (Na,Nb)\mapsto N(ab)
$$
If we have $a&#39;\neq a$ which leads to $Na=Na&#39;$, then we must guarantee that $N(a&#39;b)=N(ab)$. Otherwise, one &#39;input&#39; $(Na,Nb)=(Na&#39;,Nb)$ will get two (or even more) &#39;output&#39; $N(ab)$ and $N(a&#39;b)$, thus &#39;$\cdot$&#39; cannot be a map, which is not &#39;well-defined&#39;.
​    So, from now on, if we need to deal with some questions which have to define a &#39;map&#39;, then we will <strong>always</strong> consider whether this map is &#39;well-defined&#39;.</p>

<p>​    When we have the <strong>theorem 4.4</strong>, we can definitely to claim that</p>

<p><strong>Definition 5.5</strong> the quotient/ factor group, $G/N$
​    If $N$ is a <strong>normal</strong> subgroup of group $G$, then all cosets of $N$ form a group, which we called it the quotient group, $G/N$ (read $G$ <strong>modulo</strong> $N$, or simply $G$ mod $N$).
​    The element in $G/N$, $gN$ or $Ng$, we usually write it as $\bar g$ without confusion.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong> In example 1, we have proved $n\Z\lhd \Z$ for all $n\in \Z$. In particular, choose $n&gt;2$, then we have the quotient group:
$$
\Z/n\Z = {\bar0, \bar1, \cdots, \overline{n-1}}
$$
Can you find the relationship between this group to &#39;the group of roots of $x^n=1$ in $\C$&#39; (section 1.2)?</p>

<p>​    It is easy to know: </p>

<p><strong>Theorem 5.6</strong> the order of the quotient group
​    If $N$ is a normal subgroup of group $G$, then the order of $G/N$ equals to $|G|/|N|$. [<strong>Ex 1.5.5</strong>]</p>

<p>​    Until now, we have already learn many &#39;quotient&#39; things in math, such as quotient set, quotient topology, quotient space (in linear algebra), and so on. Why all these different concepts have the same adjective &#39;quotient&#39;? In general, the &#39;quotient&#39; something implies a <em>partition</em> of it. </p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong> quotient operation vs. quotient group
​    (1) $6\div3 \to$ 6 books, 3 of them consists of a packet, and you have 2 packets.
​    (2) $G/N \to$ $|G|$ books, $|N|$ of them consists of a packet, and you have $|G|/|N|$ packets. (Notice that in group theory, all cosets of one subgroup have the same order, so we can do such an analogy.)</p>
