<h3>1.7 The Fundamental Theorem of Homomorphisms</h3>

<h4>The fundamental theorem of homomorphisms</h4>

<p>​    A group without the &#39;dimension&#39; like the linear space, so every conclusion with respect to the dimension in linear algebra has not the parallel conclusion in group theory. But others are not the same. To be a parallel conclusion with the part of <strong>Theorem L.3 (2)</strong>, we have: </p>

<p><strong>Theorem 7.1</strong> the fundamental theorem of homomorphisms/ the first isomorphism theorem
    Let $f:G\to H$ is a homomorphism, then there is an isomorphism $\bar f$ induced by $f$:
$$
\begin{align}
\bar f: G/\ker f &amp;\xrightarrow{\sim} \mathrm{im} f \
          \bar g &amp;\mapsto f(g)
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>​    <em>Proof</em>: Define the &#39;map&#39;:
$$
\begin{align}
\bar f: G/\ker f &amp;\to \mathrm{im} f \
          \bar g &amp;\mapsto f(g)
\end{align}
$$
​    (i) wts. $\bar f$ is well-defined. (Why we need to prove it? What is the <strong>actually</strong> we need to prove?)
​    Let $a,b\in G$ and $\bar a = \bar b$, then we have
$$
\begin{align}
\because   &amp;\ \bar a=\bar b \
\therefore &amp;\ (\ker f)a = (\ker f)b \
\therefore &amp;\ (\ker f)(ab^{-1}) = \ker f \
\therefore &amp;\ ab^{-1} \in\ker f &amp;\text{(3.9)} \
\therefore &amp;\ f(ab^{-1}) = e&#39; \
\therefore &amp;\ f(a)f(b^{-1}) = e&#39; &amp;\text{(6.1)}\
\therefore &amp;\ f(a)(f(b))^{-1} = e&#39; &amp;\text{(6.3 (2))} \
\therefore &amp;\ f(a) = f(b)
\end{align}
$$
So $\bar f$ is well-defined.
​    (ii) wts. $\bar f$ is a homomorphism.
​    For all $\bar a, \bar b \in G/\ker f$, we have
$$
\begin{align}
\bar f(\bar a)\bar f(\bar b) &amp;= f(a)f(b) \
                             &amp;= f(ab) &amp;\text{(6.1)} \
                             &amp;= \bar f(\overline{ab}) \
                             &amp;= \bar f(\bar a\bar b) &amp;\text{(Don&#39;t forget this step!)}
\end{align}
$$
So $\bar f$ is a homomorphism.
​    (iii) wts. $\bar f$ is an injection.
​    For all $\bar a, \bar b \in G/\ker f$ ,we have
$$
\begin{align}
\bar f(\bar a) = \bar f(\bar b)
    &amp;\to f(a) = f(b) \
    &amp;\to f(a)(f(b))^{-1} = e&#39; \
    &amp;\to f(a)f(b^{-1}) = e&#39;  &amp;\text{(6.3 (2))}\
    &amp;\to f(ab^{-1}) = e&#39; &amp;\text{(6.1)}\
    &amp;\to ab^{-1} \in\ker f \
    &amp;\to (\ker f)(ab^{-1}) = \ker f &amp;\text{(3.9)}\
    &amp;\to \bar a = \bar b
\end{align}
$$
Thus $\bar f$ is a injection.
​    (iv) wts. $\bar f$ is a surjection.
​    For all $x\in \mathrm{im} f$, there is a $a\in G$ s.t. $f(a) = x$. Thus $x  = f(a)= \bar f(\bar a)\in\mathrm{im}\bar f$, i.e.  $\mathrm{im} f\subset \mathrm{im} \bar f$. And use (2), $\mathrm{im}\bar f\subset \mathrm{im}f$. So $\mathrm{im}\bar f =  \mathrm{im}f$, and $\bar f$ is a surjection.
​    So, $\bar f$ is a homomorphism and a bijection. That is to say, $\bar f$ is an isomorphism.</p>

<p>​    The whole proof is very important so that the writer strongly suggest that every reader need to absorb it <strong>without any confusion points</strong>. Not only the theorem itself is very important that we will use it frequently in the future learning, but the proof almost include all basic knowledge we have learned before as well. So we can use this proof to check ourselves the level of before learning.
​    Back to theorem itself, we give it a &#39;shocking&#39; adjective - fundamental, which strongly show its role in the group theory. In the rest of this section, we will all learn its applications. Firstly we will be back to examples in section 1.6. </p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong> For example 1 in section 1.6, we have: $GL<em>n(C)/SL</em>n(C) \cong (\C^*,\cdot)$. Without <strong>theorem 7.1</strong>, we can use the map:
$$
\begin{align}
f:GL<em>n(C)/SL</em>n(C) &amp;\to (\C^*,\cdot) \
 A\cdot SL_n(G) &amp;\mapsto \det A
\end{align}
$$
and try to prove $f$ is a isomorphism. [<strong>Ex 1.7.1</strong>]</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong> For example 5 in section 1.6, we can get a part of <strong>theorem L.3 (2)</strong> in section 1.6.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong> For example 6 in section 1.6, we have
$$
G<em>1\times\cdots\times G</em>n/G<em>i \cong G</em>1\times\cdots\times G<em>{i-1}\times G</em>{i+1}\times\cdots\times G_n
$$
The reader can use typical example $(\R^n,+)$ to understand it.</p>

<p><strong>Ex 1.7.2</strong> [!] Come back to <strong>Ex 1.5.2</strong>, try to prove that $G/K\cong (R^*,\cdot)$.</p>

<h4>The decomposition of a homomorphism</h4>

<p>​    We have known that if $f:G\to H$ is a homomorphism, then $\bar f: G/\ker f \xrightarrow{\sim} \mathrm{im} f, \bar g \mapsto f(g)$ is an isomorphism. Can we link these two homomorphisms?<br/>​    Firstly we can establish homomorphisms from $G$ to $G/\ker f$, and $\mathbb{im}f$ to $H$. There are such &#39;natural&#39; maps:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi: G &amp;\to G/\ker f \
  g &amp;\mapsto (\ker f)g
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align}
i:\mathbb{im}f &amp;\to H \
  f(g) &amp;\mapsto f(g)
\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>which $\pi$ is a surjective homomorphism, and $i$ is an embedding homomorphism. [<strong>Ex 1.7.3</strong>]
​    Now we express all these maps using a map graph.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=&quot;F:\Maki&#39;s Lab\基础代数学I - 讲义\1.7\1.png&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;zoom:60%;&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p>​    Hence we decompose an arbitrary homomorphism into three homomorphisms, which are surjective, bijective and injective. What a beautiful conclusion!</p>

<h4>Some isomorphism theorems</h4>

<p>​    We will give some &#39;isomorphism&#39; theorems as applications of the fundamental theorem.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 7.2</strong> diamond isomorphism theorem/ the second ~
​    Let $N\lhd G,\ H\leqslant G$, then 
​    (1) $H\cap N \lhd H$
​    (2) $N\lhd NH \leqslant G$
​    (3) $NH/N\cong H/(H\cap N)$</p>

<p>​    <em>Analysis</em>: For (1) and (2), we do not need any more analysis, just do it normally.
​    The third proposition has such a significant form, which tells us to use the fundamental theorem. We have two ways to prove that, for both left and right side are <strong>quotient groups</strong>.</p>

<p>​    <em>Proof</em>: 
​    (1) $H\cap N$ is obviously a subgroup of $H$ (<strong>theorem 3.5</strong>), and for any $h\in H$, $h(H\cap N)=hH\cap hN$ (Why?). Because $hH=H=Hh$ and $hN=Nh$, we have $hH\cap hN=Hh\cap Nh=(H\cap N)h$. Thus $H\cap N \lhd H$.
​    (2) We only need to prove that $NH$ is a subgroup of $G$, (The reader can use <strong>ex 1.3.5</strong> directly.) because $N$ is obviously a subset of $NH$.
$$
\begin{align}
NH(NH)^{-1} 
  &amp;= NHH^{-1}N^{-1} &amp;\text{(Why?)} \
  &amp;= NHN &amp;\text{($H,N$ are subgroups.)} \
  &amp;= NNH &amp;\text{($N$ is normal.)} \
  &amp;= NH &amp;\text{(Why?)}
\end{align}
$$
That is to say, $NH\leqslant G$.
​    (3) Define a map
$$
\begin{align}
f: NH &amp;\to H/(H\cap N) \
 nh &amp;\mapsto h(H\cap N)
\end{align}
$$
This is a homomorphism because
$$
\begin{align}
f(n<em>1h</em>1)f(n<em>2h</em>2) 
  &amp;= h<em>1(N\cap H)\cdot h</em>2(N\cap H) \
  &amp;= h<em>1h</em>2(N\cap H)
\end{align}
$$
and 
$$
\begin{align}
f(n<em>1h</em>1\cdot n<em>2h</em>2) 
  &amp;= f(n<em>1n</em>2\cdot h<em>1h</em>2) \
  &amp;= h<em>1h</em>2(N\cap H) \
  &amp;= f(n<em>1h</em>1)f(n<em>2h</em>2)
\end{align}
$$
​    Now we will induce the $\ker f$.
$$
\begin{align}
\ker f 
  &amp;= {nh\in NH|\ f(nh)=e&#39;} \
  &amp;= {nh\in NH|\ h(H\cap N)=H\cap N} \
  &amp;= {nh\in NH|\ h\in H\cap N} \
\end{align}
$$
Actually we have $h\in H\cap N \to nh \in N(H\cap N)=N$ because of (1) and $nh\in N \to h\in N\to n\in (H\cap N)$. So 
$$
\ker f={nh\in NH|\ nh\in N} = {nh|\ nh\in N} = N
$$
Finally we use <strong>theorem 7.1</strong> and prove the proposition (3). 
​    The other way, $g:H\to NH/N$, is easier than before. The writer would like to leave it to the reader. [<strong>Ex 1.7.4</strong>]</p>

<p>​    Notice that we called this theorem &#39;diamond&#39;, for we can draw such a relation graph of subgroups:</p>

<p>&lt;img src=&quot;F:\Maki&#39;s Lab\基础代数学I - 讲义\1.7\3.png&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;zoom:60%;&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p>The central four groups form a diamond, just like a suit of playing cards, the diamond.</p>

<p><strong>Ex 1.7.5</strong> [!] Let $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and $M$ is a subgroup of $G$ which contains $N$, then $N<em>G(M)/N = N</em>{G/N}(M/N)$. </p>

<p><strong>Theorem 7.3</strong> the third isomorphism theorem
​    Let $N\lhd G, M\lhd G$ and $N\leqslant M$, then $G/M\cong(G/N)/(M/N)$.</p>

<p>​    <em>Analysis</em>: Here both left and right side are quotient groups, but use the map $G/N\to G/M$ is more easier than $G\to (G/N)/(M/N)$. So the former are left to the reader. [<strong>Ex 1.7.6</strong>]
​    The latter is very interesting. We need to prove $M/N \lhd G/N$ and understand the form of elements in $(G/N)/(M/N)$, which is $gN(M/N)$. The more details will be discussed after this proof.</p>

<p>​    <em>Proof</em>: (i) wts. $M/N \lhd G/N$. 
​    It is easy to say that $M/N$ is a subgroup of $G/N$, and for every $gN\in G/N$, we have
$$
\begin{align}
gN(M/N) 
  &amp;= {gNmN|\ m\in M} \
  &amp;= {gmN |\ m\in M} \
\end{align}
$$
Because $M\lhd G$, for all $g\in G$, $gM=Mg$. That is to say, for all $m\in M$, there is a $m&#39;\in M$ s.t. $gm=m&#39;g$, so we can continue to deduce
$$
\begin{align}
gN(M/N) 
  &amp;= {gmN |\ m\in M} \
  &amp;\subset {m&#39;gN| m&#39;\in M} &amp;\text{(not &quot;=&quot;!)} \
  &amp;= {m&#39;gNN| m&#39;\in M} \
  &amp;= {m&#39;NgN| m&#39;\in M} \
  &amp;= (M/N)gN
\end{align}
$$
Thus $gN(M/N)(gN)^{-1}\subset (M/N)$, i.e. $M/N\lhd G/N$ (<strong>theorem 5.3</strong>). 
​    (ii) wts. $f:G\to (G/N)/(M/N)$ is a surjective homomorphism, and $\ker f=M$.
​    Define a map
$$
\begin{align}
f:G &amp;\to (G/N)/(M/N) \
  g &amp;\mapsto gN(M/N)
\end{align}
$$
then we have
$$
\begin{align}
f(g<em>1)f(g</em>2) 
  &amp;= g<em>1N(M/N)\cdot g</em>2N(M/N) \
  &amp;= g<em>1N(g</em>2N(M/N))(M/N) &amp;\text{(use (i))} \
  &amp;= g<em>1g</em>2N(M/N) \
  &amp;= f(g<em>1g</em>2)
\end{align}
$$
and $f$ is obviously a surjection.
​    For the kernel of $f$
$$
\begin{align}
\ker f 
  &amp;= {g\in G|\ f(g)=e&#39;} \
  &amp;= {g\in G|\ (gN)(M/N) = M/N} \
  &amp;= {g\in G|\ gN\in M/N} \
  &amp;= {g\in G|\ g\in M} &amp;\text{(Why?)}\
  &amp;= G\cap M \
  &amp;= M
\end{align}
$$
That is what we want to prove.</p>

<p>​    Here we want to discuss more things. First, what is the form of elements in $(G/N)/(M/N)$? We just need to write it <strong>step by step</strong>
$$
\begin{align}
(G/N)/(M/N) 
  &amp;= {x(M/N)|\ x\in G/N} \
  &amp;= {gN(M/N)|\ g\in G} \
\end{align}
$$
Second, can we simplify the form of $N(M/N)$? Also do it <strong>step by step</strong>
$$
\begin{align}
N(M/N) 
  &amp;= {nmN|\ n\in N, m\in M} \
  &amp;= {(nm)N|\ n\in N, m\in M} \
  &amp;= (NM)/N &amp;\text{($N\lhd M$, so $MN=M$ is a group.)} \
  &amp;= M/N
\end{align}
$$
In conclusion, we can get 
$$
\begin{align}
(G/N)/(M/N) 
  &amp;= {gN(M/N)|\ g\in G} \
  &amp;= {g(M/N)|\ g\in G} \
\end{align}
$$
For every $g(M/N)$, 
$$
\begin{align}
g(M/N) 
  &amp;= {gmN|\ m\in M} \
  &amp;= {gNm|\ m\in M} \
  &amp;= (gN)\cdot{m\in M} \
  &amp;= gNM \
  &amp;= gM
\end{align}
$$
So 
$$
\begin{align}
(G/N)/(M/N) 
  &amp;= {g(M/N)|\ g\in G} \
  &amp;= {gM|\ g\in G} \
  &amp;= G/M
\end{align}
$$
??? (TBD: proof and discussion below theorem 7.3 may have some error.)</p>

<p>​    The last isomorphism theorem show the relationship between the subgroup of $G$ which contains $N$, a normal subgroup of $G$, and the subgroup of $G/N$. The writer would like to leave its proof to the reader, for all proof method which we needed have been learned before.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 7.4</strong> Lattice isomorphism theorem/ the fourth ~ [<strong>Ex 1.7.7</strong>]
​    Let $N$ is a normal subgroup of the group $G$. Assume two set collections $S$ and $S&#39;$
$$
\begin{align}
S  &amp;= {A\leqslant G|\ A\geqslant N} &amp;\text{(all subgroups of $G$ which contains $N$)} \
S&#39; &amp;= {A&#39;\leqslant G/N} &amp;\text{(all subgroups of $G/N$)}\
\end{align}
$$
Then there is a bijection between two collections
$$
\begin{align}
S &amp;\cong S&#39; \
A &amp;\mapsto A/N
\end{align}
$$
and it has the following properties: for all $A,B\leqslant G$ with $N\leqslant A$ and $N\leqslant B$
​    (1) $A\leqslant B \iff A/N\leqslant B/N$.
​    (2) $A\lhd G \iff A/N\lhd G/N$.
​    (3) $(A\cap B)/N = (A/N\cap B/N)$.</p>

<p>​    So far we have learned two kinds of tools to research the &#39;structure&#39; of groups. 
​    Subgroups help us to divide a large group into several cosets, all of which have the same &#39;shape&#39;. If the subgroup is normal, we can induce a smaller group, the quotient group. 
​    Homomorphisms let us to form a &#39;good relation&#39; between two groups. We can not only find new subgroups (kernel and image), but use simpler groups to understand more complex groups, which is the main thought in the next few sections.
​    We have strong tools, so it&#39;s time to open the door and go into the new world! That is to say, we will research several typical group, which are mentioned in section 1.2, by using subgroups and homomorphisms.</p>
